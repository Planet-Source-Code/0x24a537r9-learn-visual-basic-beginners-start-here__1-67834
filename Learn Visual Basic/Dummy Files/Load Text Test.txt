The devil told the pope " No one in the world has a better memory than I do." The Pope responded to that " Oh! Well I know this Indian guy who has the best memory in the world and I'll even prove it." Then the devil replied  "Ok I'll take your offer and if I have a better memory I get your soul" "It's a deal" he replied. Then they shook hands to make the deal official.They went to a remote village in North America to bring out the deal. There they met Roaming Bull (the Indian the Pope was talking about). The devil asked him " Do you like eggs?" The Indian replied "Yes". 50 years passed. Everyone is still alive and have forgotten about the deal. However the devil remembered the deal and went back to the village in North America and greeted the Indian saying  "How". The Indian replied " Scrambled".
